Analyze this resume and provide a comprehensive summary of ALL technical projects found.

For EACH project, structure your response as follows:

**Project Name**: [Extract the exact project name]

**What It Does (Simple Explanation)**: 
Explain in 2-3 sentences using everyday language and analogies. Avoid technical jargon. Make it understandable to someone with no technical background.

**Technical Complexity Level**: 
Rate as one of: Basic | Intermediate | Advanced | Expert

**Real-World Impact**: 
Describe who benefits from this project and how it helps solve real problems.

**Skills Demonstrated**: 
List 3-5 key skills this project showcases (e.g., problem-solving, system design, algorithm implementation)

**Impressiveness Rating**: 
Score from 1-10 with clear justification:
- 1-3: Basic/learning project
- 4-6: Solid intermediate work
- 7-8: Advanced, professional-grade
- 9-10: Exceptional, research/expert level

**Time Investment Saved**: 
Estimate: "This summary saves you [X] minutes/hours of technical research"

Example for reference:
If someone "Implemented Attention is All You Need from scratch":

**Project Name**: Transformer Neural Network (Attention Mechanism Implementation)

**What It Does**: Built the core technology that powers ChatGPT, Google Translate, and modern AI chatbots completely from scratch. This is like building a car engine from individual parts instead of buying a ready-made engine â€“ it requires understanding every component deeply.

**Technical Complexity Level**: Expert

**Real-World Impact**: This technology revolutionized how computers understand and generate human language. It's used in translation apps, virtual assistants, content creation tools, and AI chatbots that millions use daily.

**Skills Demonstrated**: Deep learning expertise, mathematical modeling, algorithm implementation, research paper comprehension, software engineering

**Impressiveness Rating**: 9/10 - This demonstrates exceptional theoretical knowledge and practical coding ability. Most engineers use pre-built versions; building from scratch shows mastery of cutting-edge AI.

**Time Investment Saved**: This summary saves you 1-2 hours of researching what "transformers" and "attention mechanisms" are in AI.
